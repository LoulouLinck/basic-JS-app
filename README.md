## OVERVIEW

The app showcasts a collection of 150 pokemons to browse through fetched from the RESTful Pokémon API: [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The pokemons will get highlighted as the user hovers over them and can read more about any one of them thanks to a modal that will open when selecting the desired pokemon.
The information displayed include its:
<br> - Name
<br> - Height
<br> - Image
<br>

## RESPONSIVE LAYOUT & ACCESSIBILITY

The app was tested to suit a wide spectrum of devices and with accessibility in mind.
<br>
Components incuding the modal and navigation bar are accessible to screen readers.
<br>
For a clean and usable design Bootstrap was implemented to the app. Thanks to this framework the layout of the library is set with optimal responsivity for a pleasant experience regardless of screen size.
